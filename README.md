# TimeSeries-Forecasting
*If you know machine learning, then it is a breeze. If you don't, then you will.*

### 🐤 Background
This time, I just did it. Took it as a challenge and to learn it. This topic was being postponed since the start. I thought *will learn, will learn sometime* because it didn't sound much exciting to me *(or say, I was worried about its complexity, without learning it)*.

Finally took an opportunity and got started. And believe me, it amazed me. Like *what*!? Time-series forecasting ***is*** amazing. And again, if you know machine learning algorithms, then it will be so helpful for you.


> **Disclaimer**: I have made this course only as a part to educate myself and anyone who is reading this. Taking the original course is appreciated. This GitHub course covers most of the lecture material *(with given credits)* in a simplified manner. Hope the reader understands my intent 🙏


*Learning means doing. Read it as a story, practice it as a real-life*
