# TimeSeries-Forecasting
*If you know a wee bit about machine learning, life is rosy. If you don't, well then, you will.*

### 🐤 Background
I did it this time; I sorta took it as a challenge to learn. This subject had been on the back burner since the beginning. I thought *will learn, will learn someday* since it didn't seem that interesting to me *(or whatever-you want to call it- I panicked at the thought of its complexity; never really learned it).* 

Anyway, it finally got a shot, and I went ahead. And trust me, it blew my mind. Like *what*!? Time-series forecasting ***is*** cool. And again, if you are into machine learning algorithms, that would help.

> **Disclaimer:** This course is made for my own and the readers' education. The original course must be taken where possible. The GitHub course covers most of the lecture materials *(with given credits)* but in a simplified way. Hope the reader understands my intent 🙏


*Learning means doing. Read it as a story, practice it in real life.*
